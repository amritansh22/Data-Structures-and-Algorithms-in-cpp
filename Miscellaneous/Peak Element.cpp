/********************************************************
Problem Statement:

	Given an array of n elements, find the 
	position of the element which is greater than 
	or equal to both of its neighboring elements.

Basic Idea:
	
	The naive approach is to use a simple linear scan.
	But we can do even better than that by using
	modified version of Binary Search which would run
	in time complexity of O(logn).

Note:
	
	This program uses 0-based indexing.
