### Who can contribute
Anyone can contribute to this repository.

### How to contribute
<ul>
<li>Fork this repository</li>
<li>Pick up an algortihm</li>
<li>Write your code</li>
<li>Create a pull request</li>
<li>Star the repository to show your support</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
Create a folder for the topic you wish to contribute in and add the respective files in that particular folder.
If a folder for a particular Data Structure or Algorithm exists. Add your codes in that folder itself.
If a folder already exists, add your codes to it.


### Additional Notes
* Code should be properly commented so as to ensure it's readability.
* If you've added code that should be tested, add tests as comments. 
* Make sure your code is properly formatted.
